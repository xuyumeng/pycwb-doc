=====================================
Building the Documentation
=====================================

To build the documentation, you will need to install the following packages and
then run the ``make doc`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "sphinx<7.0.0" sphinx_rtd_theme
    make doc

The documentation will be built in the ``docs/build/html`` directory.


.. caution::

    The rst files in the ``docs/source`` with name ``pycwb.*`` and ``modules.rst`` will be deleted when you run
    ``make doc`` for preventing caches. So please do not edit them manually or name any of your rst files with the same name.
